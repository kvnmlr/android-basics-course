# Android Beginners Courses
Implementation of course contents using Android Studio. While the courses are taught in Java, these implementations are in [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/android-overview.html) to make it more interesting for me and to learn a new language. Kotlin code can be decompiled to Java.

These are the courses from the [Google developers training](https://developers.google.com/training/android/) for android.
